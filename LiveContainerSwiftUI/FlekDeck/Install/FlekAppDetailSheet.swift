//
//  FlekAppDetailSheet.swift
//  LiveContainerSwiftUI
//
//  The app page behind an installer row: icon, developer, install button, the
//  app's setup warning, stat chips (version / size / updated / downloads),
//  screenshots and the full description.
//
//  The header is drawn from the `FSAppModel` the row already holds, so it is on
//  screen the instant the sheet opens; everything below it comes from
//  `GET /app/{app_id}` and fades in when it lands. That endpoint is FlekSt0re's
//  own — a custom repo's `app_id` is only its index in that repo's catalog, so
//  for those the page is built from the row alone. It carries what the repo's
//  catalog said (`FSAppModel`'s custom-repo fields), which for the better-filled
//  repos is most of the same page: developer, size, release date, screenshots.
